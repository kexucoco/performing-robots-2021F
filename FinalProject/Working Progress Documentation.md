## Physical Construction

**First Stage** 

We test the radio connection and decided to use two motors for movement.

**Second Stage**

Our goal is to make our Doc as tiny as possible. So we used the water bottle for Doc's body. Zhiyang build another shield for the receiver holding the radio to save space. With the wires linking the power, motors and neopixel, we put them all in the bottle, which turned out to be a sad result. Our robot lost its radio connection. We also changed the power options from the 9V battery to the rechargeable one and used the new connections between powerboost introduced during the class.

We have tested differnt combinations of radio, shields and arduino. And the debugging result might be the problem with the arduino and some wiring issue because all of the stuff stucked in the bottle. Thanks to Michael, we used new arduinos with good radio connection. And then everything worked.

**Third Stage**

We rewired the stuff and built a new body using the PEPERO snack box for the body to hold the power. Everything was fixed using the hot glue gun. We add hats, flag and hammer for performance. To balance our tall robot, we used a tape behind its body for test and finally found wood attaching its back. We also recharged the batteries to make sure it work.

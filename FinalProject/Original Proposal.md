Our Doc Dwarf is a leader among seven dwarfs which will act as the first robot communicating with Snow White. It will have two status: nervous and normal.

Construction:
- DC motors for movement
- Face: Neopixel Pad/Ring with face expressions
- Body: water bottle containing LED strips and reflective materials, two hands holding flag and hammer with servo motors

Movement:
- Nervous: Cycling with led blinking. Show angry face. Flag drops from the hand.
- Normal: Move in order and lead other dwarfs with waving flags.

**Rough Script:**

- Second Scene (Introduction of dwarfs)

  Doc leads other dwarfs in a line with flag instruction. It can move according to our control. The led strips inside its body will change with the rhythm of the     
  song.
  
- Third Scene (Meet Snow White)

  Doc meet Snow White first. He stops and approaches SW gradually. SW and Doc interact with simultaneour movement. Then all dwarfs leave.
  
- Last Scene (Save Snow White)

  Doc turns to nervous mode. Flag drops from his hand and he starts to move around and try to find the prince. He change his face into angry mode.
  
## Current Progress
  
We build the physical body of our Doc. The radio connection is adjusted to work now. It can move in four directions by the button remote control. We use the bottle for the body and add Neopixel strips inside. Codes for the neopixel are still under test. Servo motors for hands and Neopivel pad for face is added but not coded. We will add more reflective materials inside the body and contact Judi to add some hair and hat for our Doc.

Here is the current progress picture:

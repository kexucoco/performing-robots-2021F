## Responses to _The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious_ by Lydia H. Liu

It is intersting to see the author compare the Chinese philosophy of Confucius's disciples and Daoist disciples for the discussion of the entanglement of humans and their machines. Discussions about the philosophy of two parties featured cultural and world view, so it is really inspiring to see Liu discuss how the modern digital media and the human-robot relationship reflected the ancient parable. I personally prefer Confucius's view of good of technology as I still believe that for now human beings enjoy more of the benefits of robots. But I agree that our view of the future and expectation of becoming immortal have been greatly changed by the introduction of robots. But there is also a feature of every epoch-making technology - transforming human beings perception of this world. With those machines and robots, we can understand this world further.
